Geometry Project

This project implements a Java application for managing 2D and 3D geometric shapes. It showcases the use of object-oriented programming principles such as abstraction, inheritance, and encapsulation. The application includes a custom `LinkedList` class for dynamic storage and a REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop) interface for user interaction.

## Features
### 1. Geometric Classes
- **Abstract Classes:**
  - `Geometry2D`: Represents 2D shapes with an abstract `getArea()` method.
  - `Geometry3D`: Represents 3D shapes with an abstract `getVolume()` method.
- **Derived Classes:**
  - **2D Shapes:**
    - `Rectangle`: Defined by its length and width.
    - `Circle`: Defined by its radius.
    - `Triangle`: Defined by its base and height.
  - **3D Shapes:**
    - `Sphere`: Defined by its radius.
    - `TriangularPrism`: Defined by its base, height, and length.

### 2. LinkedList Implementation
- **Custom LinkedList:**
  - A dynamic storage system for managing 2D and 3D shapes.
  - Methods:
    - `add`: Adds a shape to the list.
    - `remove`: Removes a shape from the list.
    - `find`: Finds a shape by its index.
    - `printAll`: Displays all shapes in the list.

### 3. REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop)
- **Interactive Console:**
  - Allows users to add, remove, find, and display shapes.
  - User-friendly prompts for input.
  - Ensures flexibility and ease of use.

## Use Cases
- **Educational Tool:** Demonstrates OOP principles in Java.
- **Geometry Software:** Serves as a prototype for calculating areas and volumes.
- **Dynamic Management:** Efficiently stores and retrieves geometry objects.
